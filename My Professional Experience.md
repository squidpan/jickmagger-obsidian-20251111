### First version

NPQS distributes consolidated streaming prices to market data price consumers both on prem and in the cloud.
There are 4 components:
- Prime Linux server with Oracle backend - on prem
- Feeding into OCP4, on Private Cloud - on prem
- AWS Cloud - Streaming and Rest API
- Mulesoft API Proxy - Rest API

I am currently working as a release coordinator at FRBNY where my primary responsibility is to ensure every Prime market data pricing service release is successfully deployed to higher environments (QA, PROD).
In the Pre-QA environment, I conduct code reviews, test all deployment commands and steps (manual, automatic), revise documentation accordingly and perform basic functional and non-functional  testing as part of cutting a release tag for QA. I also support Scrum master and PMS with writing JIRA stories from requirements.

- Turn requirements to prioritized JIRA stories into release items
- Document key functional implementation features in release, if any needs communicated to stakeholders
- Perform functional and non-functional tests
	- Suspect data cleaning and distribution
	- Perform regression test between two releases via Data quality tools that compare prices from consecutive releases to detect any degradation in data quality
	

### For someone with experience

test all deployment steps and commands internal software applications as well as e-commerce websites on a daily basis. My day-to-day activities include functional testing, manual blackbox testing, regression and smoke testing. Before that, I was working as a freelance tester for upwork and I also took several courses in software testing where I learned about agile/scrum methodologies, SDLC (Software Development Life cycle) and how to create better test plans and test cases. Although I enjoy my current work and I have learned a lot here, I think it’s time to move on and it's been a dream of mine to work on commercial software products which is why I am very excited to learn more about this opportunity at Tech Abc**

A: Yes, absolutely. I can give you a quick run down of my resume if you’d like.

So My name is Paul Lyu, I have been in the software testing field for about 2 years now.

One of my first software testing/QA job was at Foot shoepheria which is an e-commerce website. I worked in a team of 12 people. We had 5 testers, 5 developers, one business analyst and a project manager.

My main job as a manual tester was to translate the business requirements from the marketing team, create a test plan , get it approved by our manager and then come up with the test cases accordingly.

I was basically in charge of testing any new changes that were introduced for the website, test the login functionality, find bugs and report them to the developers.

My second job at Dsw.com was pretty similar to my first one. It consisted a lot regression testing as they had a huge set of test cases to execute manually every release. At this job I also got introduced to the Agile methodology and how to work in a fast paced agile environment. We used to follow the scrum method working in 2 week sprints. Every 2 weeks, new requirements from the marketing team came in and our engineering team used to sit together and discuss the sprint in a kickoff meeting. My main job was analyze the requirements, ask questions and then come up with as many test cases as I could.
