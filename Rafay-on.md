# Hello

Hi Rafay,

The most significant part of my stay at the Bank was the front row seat at the evolution of NPQS - a systematic transformation of a custom pricing system to cloud native pricing services that are resilient. Many of the exciting part of my job was when I helped you draw architectural and technical information that warrant stakeholders review and approvals. 

This was the best job I ever had. None of this would have been possible had I not been on the squad.
Thank you for the job, Rafay.

I wish you all the best.

paul
