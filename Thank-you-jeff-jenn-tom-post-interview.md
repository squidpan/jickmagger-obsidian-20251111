# Hello

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me and discuss the current effort to leverage the dashboard UI as a self-service tool for Pulse Data users. By self-service, I understand it as being a site where users can onboard and configure access to needed functionality without IT assistance. Given that the the scope of the project is based on current support to top tier clients, it must provide a solid set of use cases that needs to be mapped to UI actions and tested. Please let me know if I misunderstood anything.

My experience working at the Federal Reserve bank of New York* would allow me to help the team in documenting the details of the current process, understand all dashboard functionality, map current process to the dashboard, document in terms of steps (e.g. screenshots and instructions) and test.
